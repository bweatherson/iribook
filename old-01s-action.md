## From Action to Knowledge {#action}

This book argues that knowledge is interest-relative. The main argument for this conclusion is, in the first instance, an argument for a disjunctive conclusion: either knowledge is interest-relative, or scepticism is true. The argument will resemble arguments to the same disjunctive conclusion in @Hawthorne2004 and @FantlMcGrath2009. Indeed, it is inspired by those discussions. But it uses less controversial premises than previous versions.

The argument starts by considering a game, one I'll call the red-blue game. Here are the rules of the game.

1.  Two sentences will be written on the board, one in red, one in blue.
2.  The player will make two choices.
3.  First, they will pick a colour, red or blue.
4.  Second, they say whether the sentence in that colour is true or
    false.
5.  If they are right, they win. If not, they lose.
6.  If they win, they get \$50, and if they lose, they get nothing.

Our player is Anisa. She has been reading some medieval history, and last night was reading about the Battle of Agincourt. She was amused to see that it too place on her birthday, October 25, and in 1415, precisely 555 years before her own birthday. 

She knows the rules of the Red-Blue game, and no other relevant facts about the game. When the game starts, the following two sentences are written on the board, the first in red, the second in blue.

*  Two plus two equals four.
*  The Battle of Agincourt took place in 1415.

Intuitively, there is a unique rational play in this game: Red-True. That is, Anisa announces that she will evaluate the truth value of the red sentence, and then announce that it's true. That's a sure \$50.

But there is also an argument that Anisa need not play Red-True. For one thing, we would normally say that Anisa knows that the Battle of Agincourt took place in 1415. She read this in a reliable source, she believed it when she read it, and nothing is going wrong with her memory. And for another thing, we normally think that people can take for granted things that they know when making decisions. Jessica @Brown2013 has given this principle a name.

K-Suff

:   If *S* knows that *p*, then *S* can rationally take *p* as given in
    practical deliberation.

The following trio seems to be inconsistent:

1. Anisa knows that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415.
2. Anisa is rationally required to play Red-True.
3. K-Suff is true.

By 1 and 3, Anisa can take for granted that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415. So the value of playing Blue-True, for her, is equal to its value
conditional on the Battle of Agincourt having been in 1415. So it is at least
as valuable as playing Red-True. So she can't be rationally required to
play Red-True. Hence the three propositions are inconsistent.

And this result appears to be worrying. It is intuitive that Anisa knows that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415. For another thing, it seems this form of argument generalises. For almost any proposition at all, if it is represented by the blue sentence, Anisa should still play Red-True. And hence Anisa does not know that proposition. So she knows very little.

The interest-relative theory of knowledge says that this argument is sound, Anisa does not know that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415, but the broader sceptical conclusions do not follow. Before she played the game, Anisa did know that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415. It is only now, when that proposition is crucial to a game that she's playing, that she does not know. The same is true for the more general sceptical conclusion. For most things Anisa now believes, there is a version of the Red-Blue game during which she would not know them. But that is consistent with saying that right now, most of her beliefs are pieces of knowledge.

This way of thinking about the game requires that what Anisa knows is sensitive to what her practical situation is. Last night when reading the history book, she knew that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415. But now, while playing the game, and wanting to win the \$50, she does not know it. Later, when the game has finished and she returns to reading medieval history, she will know it again. Knowledge is sensitive to practical considerations in a way that that isn't always recognised in epistemology.

I'm going to call this the interest-relative theory of knowledge, or IRT for short. I'm focussing on interests rather than just practical situations for two reasons. One is that if Anisa is totally indifferent to money, then there is no rational requirement to play Red-True, so the argument that she loses knowledge doesn't go through. Another, which I'll talk about more in section \@ref(whatinterests), is that sometimes we can lose knowledge due to a change not in our practical situation, but our theoretical interests.

In the existing literature, views like this are sometimes called The view is sometimes called versions of **subject-sensitive invariantism**, since they make knowledge relevant to the stakes and salient alternatives available to the subject. But this is a bad name; of course whether a knowledge ascription is true is sensitive to who the subject of the ascription is. I know what I had for breakfast and you (probably) don't. What is distinctive is which features of the subject's situation that interest-relative invariantism says are relevant, and the name interest-relative invariantism makes it clear that it is the subject's interests. I'm also, for reasons I'll say more about in section \@ref(neutrality), not committed _invariantism_.

But while I'm tinkering a bit with terminology, the main line of argument here is familiar. The big picture is that in cases like Anisa's, principles connecting knowledge and action seem to clash with anti-sceptical principles. The anti-scepticism says that she knows when the Battle of Agincourt was fought; principles like K-Suff say that she does not. IRT solves the problem by saying (with the anti-sceptic) that she normally knows when the Battle was, but (as K-Suff implies) she does not know this in the context of playing this game. At this level of generality, the argument is very similar to ones put forward by Jeremy Fantl and Matthew McGrath [-@FantlMcGrath2002; @FantlMcGrath2009], and by John @Hawthorne2004.
