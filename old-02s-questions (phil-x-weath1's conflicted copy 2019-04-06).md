## Questions and Conditional Questions {#questions}

In the previous section I defended this principle:

Relevant Conditional Questions
:    If _S_ believes that $p$, then for any question _Q?_ that _S_ is currently taking an interest in, _S_ is disposed to answer the questions _Q?_ and _If p, Q?_ the same way.

To spell out what that principle amounts to, I need to say something about what questions are, and what conditional questions are. I'm going to say just enough about questions to understand the principle. This won't be anything like a full theory of questions. While much of what I say will draw on insights from theorists who have worked on questions in natural language, I'm not primarily interested in how questions are expressed in natural language. Rather, I'm interested in the contents of these questions. These contents are interesting because they can be the contents of mental states. For example, a cat can wonder where a mouse is hiding. There are deep and fascinating issues about how we can and do talk about the cat, and the cat's attitudes, but I'm more interested in the cat's relationship to the question _Where is the mouse hiding?_ than I am in our talk about the cat.^[A useful introduction to ways in which questions are relevant to philosophy of language is the Stanford Encyclopaedia article by @sep-questions.]

The simplest questions are true/false questions, like _Did the Boston Red Sox win the 2018 World Series?_. These won't play a huge role in what follows, but they are important to have on the table. I am going to assume that whenever someone considers a proposition, and they don't take its truth value to be settled, they are interested in the question of whether it is true.

Next, there are quantitative questions, where the answer is some number or sequence of numbers.^[I'm including here any question that could be answered with a number or sequence of numbers, even if that would not be the most usual, or the most helpful, way to answer them. So _Where is Fenway Park?_ is a quantitative question, because _42.3467$\degree$ N, 71.0972$\degree$ W_ is an answer, even if _The corner of Jersey St and Van Ness St_ is a better answer.] One tricky thing about quantitative questions is that they may admit of imprecise answers, but need not.

If I ask "When does tonight's Red Sox game start?", an answer of "Seven" would usually be acceptable, even if the game actually starts at a few minutes after seven. That's because, I take it, the truth conditional content of the utterance "Seven" in this context is that tonight's Red Sox game starts at approximately seven, and I'm asking a question that admits of an approximate answer. I could have been asking a question where the only acceptable answer would be the time that the Red Sox game starts to the nearest minute, or even to the nearest second. And I could even have asked that question using those exact same words. (Though if I intended to ask the question about seconds, using these words would be extremely unlikely to result in communicative success.)

The main thing that matters for the purposes of this book is that the questions with different appropriate answers are different questions. Even if one would normally use the same words in English to express the questions, the fact that they have different acceptable answers shows that they are different questions.

And as noted above, what really matters for this book is the mental representation of the contents of questions. There could be two people who we could report as wondering when tonight's Red Sox game starts, but one of them will cease wondering if they find out that it starts around seven, and the other still wonders which minute near seven it will start at. These people are wondering about different questions.

The more precise a numerical question one is considering, the fewer things one can rationally take for granted in trying to answer it. So the version of IRT I defend implies that the more precise a numerical question one is considering, the fewer things one knows. This 


So sometimes we are wondering what to do, or what do buy, or where to go, or when to go there. These are all practical questions in the sense that I mean here. To answer them is to make a decision, such as to do this, to buy that, to go there or to leave now. These questions often have multiple permissible answers. If I'm at the supermarket, and I need eggs, then part of the answer to the question what to buy is that I should buy eggs. I should buy free-range eggs, because caged eggs are immoral. And I should buy eggs that aren't cracked, because it's a waste of time and money to buy cracked eggs. But when faced with a wall of similar looking cartons of eggs, I can answer the question _which one to buy_ completely arbitrarily.

To use a bit of jargon, practical questions usually admit of 'mention-some' answers. Compare these two little exchanges.

1. a. Who was in the Beatles?
   b. John Lennon was in the Beatles.
2. a. Where can I get good coffee in Melbourne?
   b. You can get good coffee at St. Ali.

There is something wrong with 1b as an answer to 1a. It's true that John Lennon was in the Beatles. But an ordinary use of 1a will be to ask for the names of everyone in the Beatles, not just one person in them. (There are exceptions, and it's a fascinating task to work out when they occur. But it's not my fascinating task.) On the other hand 2b is a perfectly good answer to 2a. (Or so I think, but my knowledge of Melbourne coffee is a little out of date.) It is definitely not necessary to properly answer 2a that one list every place in Melbourne where one can get good coffee. That could take some time. Moreover, 2b does not (on its most natural reading) imply that St. Ali is the only place in Melbourne to get good coffee.

An answer is a 'mention-some' answer when it does not imply exclusivity in this sense. And a question admits of mention-some answers when it is properly answered with a mention-some answer. Now the main point I want to stress here is that practical questions are usually mention-some in thise sense. When I am thinking about what to buy, and I choose one particular carton of eggs, I don't thereby imply that there is anything defective about the other cartons. I just choose some eggs.

For related reasons, answering a practical question like this is distinct from answering any question, or questions, about the modal status of different actions. Imagine that in the grip of choice-phobia I am stuck staring at the cartons of eggs, unable to decide which one to buy because they are all just alike. In that situation I might know that there is no carton such that it is what I should buy, and also that there are many cartons such that I could (rationally, morally) buy any one of them. But there are so many, and they are so alike and I can't decide, so I don't know what to buy.

Resolving this indecision will not involve accepting any modal proposition like _I should buy this carton in particular_. It better not, because I really have no reason to accept any such proposition. Rather, it involves accepting a proposition like _I will buy this carton in particular_. And that I can accept by simply buying the eggs. But there were many answers I could equally well have accepted, since there were many other cartons I could buy.^[I'm here mildly disagreeing with Jason [@Stanley2011, Ch. 5] when he says that these questions with infinitival complements can be paraphrased using modals. But only mildly since (a) we might think 'will' just is the modal that gets used in the paraphrase, as @Bhatt1999 suggests, and (b) the differences between _what to buy_ and _what may I buy_ are small enough that maybe we can describe the latter as a 'paraphrase' of the former.]
