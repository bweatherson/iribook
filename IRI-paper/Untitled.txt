On page 9, I think it is worthwhile saying a bit more about how BCI has implications for what Joe rationally believes, although it does not have applications in the bribed to keep investigating case. I think all you need to say is that Joe's situation is normal enough that he should rationally act as if p iff he should rationally believe p. But this might be made explicit.

In the psychopathy case, I think you are saying something like this already, but there is a simple way to put the point. Cognitive failings, like psychopathy or stupidity, might make negative evaluations (like blame) go away, but they don't typically produce positive evaluations. Same in epistemology; if Joe and Sam try to solve the puzzle and fail, the stupid one might fail blamelessly, while the smart one is blameworthy. But knowledge is like blamelessness.
