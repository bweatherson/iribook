# What Kind of Interests?

Stanley's book on IRI is called _Knowledge and Practical Interests_. And he defends a theory on which what an agent knows depends on the practical questions they face. But this is not the only way to set out IRI. In particular, one could also say that what the agent knows is sensitive to their theoretical interests. 

On my preferred version of IRI, an agent knows that _p_ only if the rational answer to a question she faces is the same unconditionally as it is conditional on _p_. What it is for an agent to face a question is dependent on the agent's interests. If that's how one thinks of IRI, the question of this section becomes, should we restrict questions the agent faces to just being questions about what choice to make? Or should they include questions that turn on her thoeretical interests, but which are irrelevant to choices before her. There are two primary motivations for allowing theoretical interests as well as practical interests to matter.

One reason comes from a puzzle for IRI devised by Jessica [#Brown200x;]. The general puzzle is that if only practical interests matter, then the agent should come up with different answers to the question _What to do in situation S_ depending on whether the agent is actually in _S_, or they are merely musing about how one would deal with that situation. And it is unintuitive that this should matter.

Let's make that a little less abstract. Imagine Chika is not actually faced with the choice between the red and blue tickets. In fact, she has no practical decision to make that turns on whether the Red Sox won. But she is idly musing over what she would do if she were offered the red ticket and the blue ticket. If she knows the Red Sox won, then she should be indifferent between the tickets. After all, she knows they will both return \$1. But intuitively she should think the red ticket is preferable, even in the abstract setting. And this seems to be the totally general case.

The general lesson is that if whether one can take _p_ for granted is relevant to the choice between A and B, it is similarly relevant to the theoretical question of whether one would choose A or B, given a choice. And since those questions should receive the same answer, if _p_ can't be known while making the practical deliberation between A and B, it can't be known while musing on whether A or B is more choiceworthy. 

This point is related to what Fantl and McGrath call the 'unity of reasons' thesis [xx][#FantlMcGrath2009]. They argue, convincingly I think, that whether _p_ is an available reason for an agent is independent of whether the agent is engaged in practical or theoretical deliberation. Now whether _p_ is a reason can turn on interests. Ankita has _This paper contains no typos_ available as a reason; it might be one reason for her to feel happy with the paper. But Bojan does not have that available as a reason; it is not a reason for him to refrain from checking the paper again. But the interests that are relevant can be any kind of interests.

[#Weatherson201x;] suggests another reasons for including theoretical interests in what's relevant to knowledge. There is something odd about the following reasoning: _The probability of p is precisely x_, therefore _p_, in any case where $x < 1$. It is a little hard to say, though, why this is problematic, since we often take ourselves to know things on what we would admit, if pushed, are purely probabilistic grounds. The version of IRI that includes theoretical interests allows for this. If we are consciously thinking about whether the probability of _p_ is _x_, then that's a relevant question to us. Conditional on _p_, the answer to that question is clearly no, since conditional on _p_, the probability of _p_ is 1. So anyone who is thinking about the precise probability of _p_, and not thinking it is 1, is not in a position to know _p_. And that's why it is wrong, when thinking about _p_'s probability, to infer _p_ from its high probability.
