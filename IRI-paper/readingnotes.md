# Brown 2013

# Grimm 2015
Quotes Locke and Clifford sounding IRish
Truth-directed as contrast; this feels wrong in Harman cases
Thinks all interests attributor knows about relevant. This seems more like contextualism to me, and in any case fails for quantified cases
13 nice quotes about the stability problem, e.g., Doris and Russell

# Eaton and Pickvance 2015
IRI allows you to go from not knowledge to knowledge by evidence against
Take this to be obvious problem
But of course anyone who allows Gettier cases would allow this too
Terrible paper

# Boyd 2015

Seems entirely to do with debunking
Thinks the relevant action principles are about epistemic responsibility, not action
I don't really know why he thinks that
Seriously the argument here is all that IRI is so antecedently implausible that should jump for other argument
Does lack of knowledge *explain* the lack of appropriate action - not really for me

Also value based argument against Lackey in section 5
