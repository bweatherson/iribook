## A Theory of Belief {#beltheory}

Here's the positive theory of belief that I'm going to defend in this book.

> _S_ believes that $p$ just in case
    1. For all questions _S_ is interested in, updating with the information that $p$ yields a state that is consistent with her prior state with respect to that question.
    2. For some possible decision, _S_ regards one option as (at least weakly) dominating another option, though she regards the second option as possibly better than the first conditional on $\neg p$.

Both of these clauses require a little bit of spelling out.

The key notions in clause 1 are 'updating' and 'consistency'. For now, I'm going to treat updating as just conditionalising. That will get complicated in a bit; updating on a modal claim, for instance, doesn't involve conditionalising on it. But it helps to see the structure of the theory
