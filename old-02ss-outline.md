### A Hybrid Pragmatist Theory of Belief {#outine}

The view of belief that I'm going to defend is that belief must satisfy two conditions. A thinker _S_ believes that $p$ if and only if:

1. There is some practical question where _S_ is disposed to rely on $p$ in dominance reasoning.
2. For all questions _S_ is currently interested in, every permissible answer to that question conditional on $p$ is also a permissible answer to the question.

The theory I'm defending is very similar in its structure to that defended by Dorit @Ganson2019. So I'm simply adopting the name she uses. There are some minor differences in detail, that I'll return to in subsection \@ref(ganson), but I think the commonalities in structure are enough to warrant using a common name rather than introducing new terminology.

The two parts to the theory use very different quantifiers. The first part quantifies existentially over all possible practical questions. The second part quantifies universally over practical and theoretical questions, but with a restriction to questions _S_ is interested in. It's this last restriction that makes the theory interest-relative. But both parts of the theory are needed for the theory to be plausible. In the next two subsections, I'll describe, and defend, the two clauses.
