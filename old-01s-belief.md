## Belief, Interests and Knowledge {#beliefsection}

Assume that Anisa is back playing the original Red-Blue game, and she is rational. Then she will not believe that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415. If she did believe that, she'd believe that playing Blue-True would return $50. And if she believed that, she would believe Blue-True and Red-True were equally reasonable choices. But that would be a mistake, and not something that rational Anisa would believe. So she does not believe that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415.

But before the game was played, she did believe that. So we get the result that Anisa's beliefs are interest-relative, just like her knowledge. And I'm going to spend most of chapter \@ref(belief) setting out just how I think belief relates to interests.

But I used to believe something stronger. In Anisa's case, it is plausible that the interest-relativity of belief explains the interest-relativity of knowledge. Anisa does not know when the Battle of Agincourt was because she is not in a position to rationally believe it was in 1415. And she's not in a position to rationally believe that because given her interests, belief requires more evidence than she has. At least in this one case, it is plausible that the interest-relativity of belief is doing all the explanatory work. I used to think this was always the case; that all interest-relativity in epistemology could be explained by the interest-relativity of belief.

It's helpful to have some terminology for the kind of view I used to have. Any version of IRT will say that there are sentences of the form *S knows that p* whose truth depends on the interests, in some sense, of *S*. But we can divide IRT theories up according to whether or not they think belief is central to interest-relativity.

Doxastic IRT

:   Knowledge ascriptions are interest-relative, but their interest-relativity traces solely to the interest-relativity of the corresponding belief ascriptions.

Non-Doxastic IRT

:   Knowledge ascriptions are interest-relative, and their  interest-relativity goes beyond the interest-relativity of the  corresponding belief ascriptions.

A  theory that holds both that belief ascriptions are interest-relative, and that some of the interest-relativity of knowledge ascriptions is not explained by the interest-relativity of belief ascriptions, will count as a version of non-doxastic IRT. This book defends just such a version of IRT.

In my first paper on IRT [@Weatherson2005-WEACWD], I tried to motivate Doxastic IRT. Part of my  idea was to endorse a position that's usually known as  'strict invariantism' about these classes of statements:

* *S* is rational[^RatJust] in having credence *x* in *p*;
* If *S* believes that *p*, she knows that *p*

That is, I argued that interests were not relevant to the truth of statements from these classes. Interests did not affect rational credence, and interests did not affect whether a rational belief amounted to knowledge. The interests of the subject did, I argued, affect the following three classes of statements, but it was the first that did all the work.

* *S* believes that *p*;
* *S* rationally believes that *p*;
* *S* knows that *p*.

But I didn't argue for all of that. What I argued for was Doxastic IRT about ascriptions of rational belief, and I hinted that the same arguments would generalise to nowledge ascriptions. I now think those hints were mistaken, and want to defend Non-Doxastic IRT about knowledge ascriptions. My change of heart was  first  prompted by examples  like those Jason @Stanley2005-STAKAP calls 'Ignorant High Stakes' cases. (In my variants the subject is mistaken not ignorant, and what they are mistaken about is the odds, not the stakes, but it's the same basic idea.) In cases where someone has irrational and false beliefs about the odds of various gambles they face, interests can affect what they know in ways that are not explained by the interest-relativity of belief. I will have much more to say about this in chapter \@ref(knowledge).

[^RatJust]: Actually in the earlier paper I talked about _justified_ credences and _justified_ beliefs. I now think this was a mistake, and we should focus on _rational_ credences and beliefs instead. In ordinary English we talk about rational and irrational beliefs, as well as reasonable and unreasonable beliefs, and we talk about justified and unjustified actions. But talk of justified and unjustified beliefs is largely confined to philosophy. And I would rather start with the ordinary notions, and return much later to figuring out how, if at all, justification applies to belief. We do, to be sure, talk about justified fears and justified suspicions in ordinary English. But figuring out how fears and suspicions relate to knowledge and belief is well beyond the scope of this book and my understanding.
