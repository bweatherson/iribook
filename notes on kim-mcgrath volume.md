# Introduction

Argument that it's better to use reason condition rather than practical adequacy condition

Credited to Hawthorne circa 2007

Choice between two options neither 100% perfect both equally likely to be good. If you knew one was good it would be better, so this implies you don't know that either is good. But this is absurd. In the supermarket, you know each carton of eggs is safe. 

Solution: don't use change of preferences of the key notion. Instead, use something like choice set in the sense that Sen talks about. What's bad is if adding the proposition move something from outside the choice to inside it. 

Puzzle:  why do we care about this direction of movement, but not the reverse direction? Answer, it is not irrational to decline arbitrary member of choice set. 

Puzzle: what if all powerful all knowing deity says that one carton in particular is safe? Answer, that destroys other knowledge by changing practical adequacy. On F&M view, have to say that this divine intervention means that you lose a reason you previously had. But this seems mysterious. It would be fine to say that you now have extra reason to choose the chosen eggs. But they can't say that; core to their program that knowing p is a maximally good reason and being sure is not a better reason. 

Extra reason to do things with choice sets rather than preferences. Play the red green game But with a third option that's better than both. Then red is preferred to green, but this does not destroy your knowledge. Example, say that the player can answer an open ended question winning $100 if they get the answer right. Idea for a question, what sport did America first win a women's Olympic gold-medal? It was Golf apparently in the weird 1900 Olympics. In this case, I think we still want to say that knowledge about Avignon is preserved.

Note that we can do eggs case by making red sentence a different claim about Avignon.

Might say something too about stability, though maybe this is one of the chapter 5 sections. Making it go intellectual helps some. But I think it is worth hanging tough; we just do know less when considering insurance than in normal cases.

The stuff on page 17 abiut framing decision problems is good, and should be cited. Also the Nozick quote. 

The theory on page 23 looks kind of woolly, can think of my view as spelling it out. And the link to Ryle is correct. 

The response to Brown on page 26 is right, but a bit weak. Saying it is vague is a bit better. 

Not sure about the responses to R*S, but shuld cite. Also Tang (2015) on R&S

# Nolfi

The def on PE on 35 is wrong. It makes any thiery that handles dead dictator cases correctly a PE theory

Connects PE to functionalism about belief. But goes way overboard - belief aims at practical adequacy. My historical beliefs really do not

# Baril

How does PE connect to folks with bad values/wacky theories of reasons?

Note that im ambivalent about what to say about dead dictator, and hence about ignorant high stakes cases. 

A bit ambivalent about whether conditionalising on p has to preserve rationality or morality. Could go either way on that. This seems relevant to the Old Master example she has. The racism example is boring; if people double check for bad reasons, they lose belief and hence knowledge.

I didn't like this paper first time I read it, not sure second time will be better.

Definition of PE at start, only truth relevant factors affect knowledge. But I think that too. I just think how many you need is relevant. That said, is coherence a truth relevant factor. Maybe?

Bigger picture, I am not offering necessary and sufficient conditions for belief. No theory of dead dictators or fake barns or  Church-style Gettier variants, or margin of error cases.
