Interests and Evidence

There is a very nice argument for the interest relativity of knowledge that presupposes that evidence is not interest relative. This argument suggests that only an interest relative account of knowledge will be consistent both with an anti-sceptical outlook, and with some intuitive ideas about how rational agents respond to their evidence and choices. Unfortunately, this argument presupposes a theory of evidence, and does not explain how evidence itself could be interest relative. And there are arguments, due largely to Williamson, that if knowledge is interest relative, evidence must be too. This paper outlines a possible way through the problem. I use some tools from game theory to outline how we might make evidence sensitive to interests, without requiring that interest relativity is motivated solely by the idea that rational agents are responding correctly to their evidence.
