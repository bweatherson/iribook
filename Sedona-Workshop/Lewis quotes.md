Lewis quotes

Radical Interpretation, appendix (120)

> The best interpretation for Karl is the one assigned to him by the scheme of interpretation that does best overall, even if it does not do so well in his exceptional case. And the best scheme is _ipso facto_ correct: to believe that one is a fool, or to desire fame, is to be such that the best scheme for your kind assigns those attitudes to you.

Reduction of Mind (322)

> The behaviourist says that the subject _has_ that system of beliefs and desires that best makes sense of how the subject is disposed to behave. Whereas I'd say that the inner state _is_ that system of beliefs and desires that best makes sense of the behaviour which that state is apt for causing in subjects. Thus I'd use constitutive rationality not to dispense with causally effective inner states, but rather to define their content.

Reduction of Mind (324)

> Its content is defined, insofar as it is defined at all, by constitutive rationality on the basis of its typical causal role.
