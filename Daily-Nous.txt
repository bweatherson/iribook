## Old-Fashioned Thoughts about Old-Fashioned Blogs

When philosophy blogging started, in the early 2000s, the primary focus was on doing philosophy. There were many, many, distractions, but the core plan was that posts would be reflections on, or contributions to, the kind of debate that you'd see in journal articles. Indeed, plenty of us who were active back then managed to turn <a href="http://tar.weatherson.org/2010/03/31/do-justified-beliefs-justify-action/">posts</a> into <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/WEAKBA">article sections</a>, or expand <a href="http://tar.weatherson.org/2004/05/13/are-humeans-out-of-their-minds/">posts</a> into <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00659.x">entire articles</a>, or to <a href="http://tar.weatherson.org/2011/03/31/ross-and-schroeder-on-belief/">cite</a> <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/ROSBCA-4">posts</a> or <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/doris-and-russell-on-stanley/#comments">comment</a> <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/WEADII">threads</a> in published work.

That aspect of blogging hasn't entirely stopped. The <a href="https://www.umsu.de/wo/">original and best philosophy blog</a> is still active. But it's mostly faded. In part this was because of technological changes to do with the introduction of HTML5. In part is was because the broader academic blogging community withered, though again <a href="http://crookedtimber.org">some</a> <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/">greats</a> remain. And it was in part because some people got a rude shock when they found out how much their <a href="https://www.ernestsosa.com">senior</a> <a href="http://www.davidestlund.org">colleagues</a> had been protecting them from administrative work when they were pre-tenure. Well, maybe that was just me.

But it's a shame that this disappeared. That's not because places like Daily Nous don't add value; of course they do. It's not even that the kind of high quality philosophical exchange that characterised the best of the blogs doesn't take place on places like DN. Some of the discussions here, both in posts and comments, really are great philosophy. It's just that the choice of topics is driven by the news or other external factors, and not simply by <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/ROSTVO-11">curiosity</a>. And there should be a place for that kind of blogging too.

That old-fashioned blogging has four big virtues. It allows folks who are geographically isolated to interact with the rest of the world. It provides an outlet for ideas that are too interesting to just file away, but not really interesting enough for a whole journal article. (That is to say, most philosophical ideas.) It is open-access, <a href="http://tar.weatherson.org/2004/10/04/six-objections-to-the-westphall-hypothesis/">public philosophy</a>, that can get read by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Westphall#Objections">non-philosophers</a>. And it helps people learn how to write.

Academia is one of the few places in the world where people have jobs that consist in large part of writing original works, and yet what they write is not independently edited. Academics are expected to be their own editors, and a lot of us are no good at this at all. [<i>Ed. Note</i>: Tell me about it.] One solution that works for some people is to practice. And, for some people (though not all) practice works best if you have to show your work. Writing something that someone you don't know might read is a distinctive skill, and one that requires practice. And being able to write something clear, informative and interesting to that unknown reader in under 750 words is a very rare skill these days, yet a vitally important one.

In my not at all humble opinion, philosophy is rapidly improving along most dimensions. You see graduate students these days with better teaching records, and better service records, than most full professors. Philosophical research skillfully integrates work from across disciplinary boundaries - though perhaps less so across sub-disciplinary boundaries. And the quantity of engagement with our fellow philosophers is going up. But I'm not sure the quality of it is. Not enough philosophers can write a clear and succinct summary of an important view, or tell a story about how a debate has progressed that is more than a play-by-play rehash of the moves that were made.

In general, we're not great writers. (I don't mean <i>you</i>, dear reader; you're in a class with Austen and Austin. But you're the exception that proves the rule.) We could all use more practice. Old-fashioned philosophy blogging isn't the perfect practice - it can inculcate bad habits as well as good ones. But it is a start.
