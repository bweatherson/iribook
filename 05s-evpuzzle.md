## A Puzzle About Evidence {#evpuzzle}

Thinknback to the red-blue game at the start of the book. But now consider a version of the game where:

-   The red sentence is that two plus two equals four.
-   The blue sentence is something that, if known, would be part of the
    agent's evidence.

I'm going to argue that there are cases where the only rational play is Red-True, but the blue sentence is something we want to say that, ordinarily, the subject knows. And I'll argue that this is a problem for the theory I have described so far. It is not a problem that shows that anything I've said so far is untrue. But it does suggest that what I've said so far is incomplete, and in a key respect unexplanatory. 

I have tried so far to argue that belief, rational belief, and knowledge are all interest-relative. And I have tried to tell a story about when they are interest-relative. In the case of knowledge, the story is reasonably simple. One loses knowledge that $p$ when the situation changes in such a way that one is no longer entitled to take $p$ as given in deliberation. But what does it mean to say that one is entitled to take something as given? I haven't given anything like a full theory of this, but the suggestion has been to interpret this on broadly evidentialist lines. In general, one is not entitled to take $p$ as given if the optimal choice, given one's evidence, is different unconditionally to what it is conditional on $p$. (Exception, as noted in section XXX, one might be rationally following a policy of ignoring certain kinds of evidence. But even in that case, what makes the policy rational is that one has evidence that costs of ignoring that kind of evidence will, in the long run, be less than the resources one would spend in properly accounting for the evidence. The story is still evidentialist, just not in quite so direct a way as you might have thought.)

But that story doesn't explain when practical considerations might affect what evidence one has. Indeed, it can't explain anything about evidence, since it takes evidence as a given. So if the arguments for the interest-relativity of knowledge can be repurposed to show that evidence too is interest-relative, we have a problem. Since I think they can be repurposed in just this way, there is a problem. The aim of this chapter is to set out just what the problem is, and to suggest a solution to it. I'll start by arguing that evidence is interest-relative, then come back to what the problem is, and how I'll aim to solve it.

Note to self
:    I've included down to 'part of her evidence' in \@ref(orthodoxevidence). Refer back to that discussion.

So let's imagine a new player for the red-blue game. Call her Parveen. She is playing the game in a restaurant. It is near her apartment in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Just before the game starts, she notices an old friend, Rahul, across the room. Rahul is someone she knows well, and can ordinarily recognise, but she had no idea he was in town. She thought Rahul was living in Italy. Still, we would ordinarily say that she now knows Rahul is in town; indeed that he is in the restaurant. As evidence for this, note that it would be perfectly acceptable for her to say to someone else, "I saw Rahul here". Now the game starts.

-   The red sentence is *Two plus two equals four*.
-   The blue sentence is *Rahul is in this restaurant*.

And here is the problem. On the one hand, there is only one rational play for Parveen: Red-True. She hasn't seen Rahul in ages, and she thought he was in Italy. A glimpse of him across a crowded restaurant isn't enough for her to think that *Rahul is in this restaurant* is as likely as *Two plus two equals four*. She might be wrong about Rahul, so she should take the sure money and play Red-True. So playing the red-blue game with these sentences makes it the case that Parveen doesn't know where Rahul is. This is another case where knowledge is interest-relative, and at first glance it doesn't look very different to the other cases we've seen.

But take a second look at the story for why Parveen doesn't know where Rahul is. It can't be just that her evidence makes it certain that two plus two equals four, but not certain that Rahul is in the restaurant. At least, it can't be that unless it is not part of her evidence that Rahul is in the restaurant. And if evidence is not interest-relative, then I think we should say that it is part of Parveen's evidence that Rahul is in the restaurant. This isn't something she infers; it is a fact about the world she simply appreciated. Ordinarily, it is a starting point for her later deliberations, such as deliberations about whether to walk over to another part of the restaurant to say hi to Rahul. That is, ordinarily it is part of her evidence.

I haven't told you a story about how evidence can be interest-relative. I haven't even started such a story. All the stories I've told you so far about interest-relativity have presupposed that the relevant evidence can be identified, and then we ask what the evidence warrants as circumstances change. That model is by its nature incapable of saying anything about when interests, or practical situations, affect evidence. The model isn't wrong - but it is in a crucial respect incomplete. On the one hand, all models are incomplete. On the other hand, it would be odd to have the model's explanatory ambitions stop somewhere between Anisa's case and Parveen's. That's the kind of explanatory failure that makes one wonder whether you've got the original cases right.

There are two ways out of this problem that I don't want to take, but are notable enough that I want to set them aside explicitly.

One is to say that propositions like *Rahul is in this restaurant* are never part of Parveen's evidence. Perhaps her evidence just consists of things like *I am being appeared to Rahul-like*. Such an approach is problematic for two reasons. The first is that it is subject to all the usual objections to psychological theories of evidence [@Williamson2007]. The second is that we can re-run the argument with the blue sentence being some claim about Parveen's psychological state, and still get the result that the only rational play is Red-True. A retreat to a psychological conception of evidence will only help with this problem if agents are infallible judges of their own psychological states, and that is not in general true [@Schwitzgebel2008].

Another option is to deny that any explanation is needed here. Perhaps pragmatic effects, like the particular sentences that are chosen for this instance of the red-blue game, mean that Parveen's evidence no longer includes facts about Rahul, and this is a basic epistemic fact without explanation. Now we shouldn't assume that everything relevant to epistemology will have an epistemic explanation. Facts about the way that proteins work in the brain do not have explanations within epistemology, although they are vitally important for there even being a subject matter of epistemology. So in principle there could be facts around here that ground epistemic explanations without having explanations within epistemology. But in practice things look less rosy. Without an explanation of why Parveen loses evidence, we don't have a theory that makes predictions about how interests affect knowledge. And we don't have a satisfying explanation of why playing Blue-True is irrational for Parveen. And we are forced, as already noted, to draw an implausible distinction between Anisa and Parveen.

We shouldn't be content with simply saying Parveen loses evidence when playing the red-blue game. We should say why this is so. The aim of the rest of this chapter is to tell a story that meets this explanatory desideratum.
