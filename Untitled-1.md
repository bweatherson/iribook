For the first direction, consider a case where S used to rationally believe $p$, then received some kind of undercutting defeater for her belief. It is really unclear how much this lowers the probability of $p$, but it does mean that S should not feel settled for her. And also imagine (quite plausibly) that $p$ is not relevant to any of her current interests, and that there is a purely possible decision problem with the following structure:

* If $p$, then A is clearly better than B.
* If $\neg p$, then A is probably better than B, but very little turns on it, and it is really complicated to calculate exactly which is better.

One could argue that
