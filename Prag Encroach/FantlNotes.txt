Fantl points

1) The genie might be evidence.

2) The argument from "cases like Barry's" is like the "pre-KA" principle on 72n14 of the book.

3) Other ways we could distinguish belief and probability 1. (I think I wasn't clear about what I was trying to do here.)

4) Is Coraline "Knowledge-level justified" in believing p? Yes; but there's a defeater.

5) Compare the principles
	S is justified in believing A will result in better outcome than B; so S should a
	S knows that A will result in better outcome than B; so S should A
    Do I distinguish these? Why?
	
6) What is Coraline justified in believing? Can she justifiably believe that she's better off taking the bet?

7) Credence and belief could be separate properties even if they are the same state, and the evaluation could attach to properties. This is fair enough; I should back down. Compare: X is a good philosopher but a bad person.

Perhaps lead off with the conclusion - less thriller -ish.
