macro:->It
is
a
tricky
exegetical
question
how
many
of
the
three
features
here
must
be
read
into
defences
of
IRI
in
the
literature.
My
reading
is
that
they
do
not
have
to
be
read
in,
so
it
is
not
overly
original
of
me
to
defend
a
version
of
IRI
that
does
away
with
all
three.
But
I
know
many
people
disagree
with
that.
If
they're
right,
this
paper
is
more
original
than
I
think
it
is,
and
so
I'm
rather
happy
to
be
wrong.
But
I'm
going
to
mostly
set
these
exegetical
issues
aside,
and
compare
different
theories
without
taking
a
stand
on
who
originally
promulgated
them.

this

$p$

macro:->I
will
consider,
and

one
principle
stronger

IRI
in

But
the
key
point
is
that
these
general
principles
are
not
needed
to
defend
IRI.

macro:->In
the
West
Gate
bridge
collapse
in
Melbourne
in
1971,
a
large
number
of
the
victims
were
underneath
the
bridge;
the
people
on
top
of
the
bridge
had
a
non-trivial
chance
of
survival.
That
bridge
was
200
feet
above
the
water,
not
1000,
but
I'm
not
sure
the
extra
height
would
matter
greatly.
Again
from
a
slightly
lower
height,
over
90\%
of
people
on
the
bridge
survived
the
I-35W
collapse
in
Minneapolis
in
2007.

I
believe
was

macro:->The
caveats
here
about
basic
sources
are
to
cancel
any
suggestion
that
Kate
has
to
antecedently
believe
that
any
source
is
reliable
before
she
uses
it.
As
\cite
{Pryor2000-PRYTSA}
notes,
that
view
is
problematic.
The
view
that
we
only
get
knowledge
from
a
street
sign
if
we
antecedently
have
reason
to
trust
it
is
not
so
implausible.

macro:->The
target
here
is
not
directly
the
interest-relativity
of
their
theories,
but
more
general
principles
about
the
role
of
knowledge
in
action
and
assertion.
But
it's
important
to
see
how
IRI
handles
the
cases
that
Brown
discusses,
since
these
cases
are
among
the
strongest
challenges
that
have
been
raised
to
IRI.

macro:->I'm
not
saying
that
consequentialism
is
wrong
as
a
theory
of
medical
ethics.
But
if
it
is
right,
so
many
intuitions
about
medical
ethics
are
going
to
be
mistaken
that
such
intuitions
have
no
evidential
force.
And
Brown's
argument
relies
on
intuitions
about
this
case
having
evidential
value.
So
I
think
for
her
argument
to
work,
we
have
to
suppose
non-consequentialism
about
medical
ethics.
