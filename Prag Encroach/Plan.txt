Summary of CWDWPE
	8 points from TAR
	Why this is a non-encroachment model
	Also add: 	Thinking about probability
Four worries for that view
	Evidence
	Margins
	Defeaters
Worries for Fantl & McGrath
	Blog post
	Several ways to try to argue that it is justified
Worries for Hawthorne & Stanley
	Unknown expected utility
Arguments for the view
	Best synthesis of credence and belief - doesn't require giving up Bayesian DT
		Compare Douven - KPR article in the folder
		Best account of closure (Nagel, PI), (Sturgeon, Nous)
		Most psychologically plausible (Nagel, AJP)
	Best treatment of cases where odds vary more than stakes (Schroeder PDF)
		See also 	Note that it is odds not stakes
	What matters is whether the salient odds cross the epistemic probability
	Major changes in stakes don't necessarily affect that (various Gods examples show this)
	So we wouldn't necessarily expect to see much difference in Feltz/Zaradine examples
		This is in PDF in directory
	Or, presumably, in May et al type examples
Citation: Practical Interests, Relevant Alternatives, and Knowledge Attributions: an Empirical Study, Review of Philosophy and Psychology, Joshua May1 , Walter Sinnott-Armstrong2 , Jay G. Hull3  and Aaron Zimmerman1, DOI: 10.1007/s13164-009-0014-3.

	Best response to Doris and Russell
Comesana
	Argues that epistemic impurism entails extreme epistemic impurism
	Relies on two premises
		A) Evidence of evidence is evidence - not always true
		B) 
"if S has more evidence for the proposition that her belief that p amounts to knowledge than S’ does for the corresponding proposition that his belief that p amounts to knowledge, and if S and S’ are evidential cousins, then S has more justification for believing p than S’ does."
	And B is obviously false on this view
