# Encroachment, Reduction and Explanation

## Red-Blue Game

## Odds not Stakes

## The Conditional Principle

* It is meant to be reductive and explanatory

## What it Requires

* Evidential Probability
* Evidence

# The Problems with Evidence

## Red-Blue and Evidence

* Can play the game with purported evidence

## Some Ways Out

Sense-data, or other kinds of internalism about evidence
Giving up reduction

## Why Reduction

Always reduce
Owe an explanation 

# Gamifying the Problem

## Newcomb as a Game

Unique Nash equilibrium

## The Interpretation Game

Situation: Bet on E, which may be evidence, at 100-1
If E not part of evidence, Pr(E) = 0.9
Players: 
Agent, who wants to maximise expected utility given Intepreter's account of what their evidence is
Interpreter, who constitutes what the agent's mental states are, and wants to predict the agent

## Table for the Interpretation Game

Note that it has two equilibria

## First Solution

It is indeterminate what the agent's evidence is, what she knows, etc.
Not my preferred option.

# The Solution and Its Discontents

## Stag Hunt and Two Selection Criteria

Pareto-dominant
Risk-dominant

## Solving the Interpretation Game

The interpreter has nothing to choose between
But the agent has a risk-based reason to choose the low-E equilibria
So it's the unique risk dominant equilibrium
So it's what gets chosen

## Problem One: Too Complex

Old solution had two theoretical principles:

1. Always maximise evidential expected utility
2. Conditionalizing on what you know doesn't change any relevant question

No equilibrium selection principle is as plausible as these.
Maybe that pushes you back to the indeterminacy option.

## Problem Two: Not Identical to the Old Solution

Case where losing cost is $15, not $100
I think that's just fine; evidence is different to knowledge
If you think E=K, this problem can't arise

# Conclusion

## Summary

1. Evidence is what a radical interpreter, who thought you were rational and wanted to predict your behaviour, would think it is.
2. This will be interest-sensitive in any number of unclear cases.
3. How the radical interpreter solves this problem depends on much more contentious aspects of game theory than orthodox utility theory, but any viable solution will be interest-relative in some sense.
