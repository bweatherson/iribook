\section{Challenges to Interest-Relative Invariantism}

There have been a number of objections to IRI over the past few years. Some of these challenges I think can be met by any version of IRI. But some of them are best met by using the resources of the the theory offered here, one that starts with the interest-relativity of belief. We just saw one such challenge -- Blome-Tillman's discussion of the supposed counterintuitiveness of denying that knowledge supervenes on evidence. We'll start with two other objections Blome-Tillman raises to IRI.
