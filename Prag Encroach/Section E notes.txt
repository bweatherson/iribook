Objections

Doris and Russell (Perhaps put in section 2)
	Can indifference/wealth etc generate knowledge?
	Of course - because they can generate *belief*
	See Doris and Russell in the folder
	Note also that defeaters are typically sensitive to all sorts of things
	Versions of dead dictator where poor person only has access to misleading evidence
		Jason makes similar points in Certain Doubts thread

Neta's State and Main example
	Problem is epistemic infection
	Similar to the point Neta raises about methods, although not exactly the same
	And somewhat less ad hoc
	See Neta - Anti-intellectualism etc in this folder

Experimental Objections
	Note that it is odds not stakes
	What matters is whether the salient odds cross the epistemic probability
	Major changes in stakes don't necessarily affect that (various Gods examples show this)
	So we wouldn't necessarily expect to see much difference in Feltz/Zaradine examples
		This is in PDF in directory
	Or, presumably, in May et al type examples
