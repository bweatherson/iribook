## Super-Knowledge to the Rescue {#super}

There are three primary assumptions behind the argument in section \@ref(action).

1. Before the game is played, Anisa knows that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415.
2. When Anisa plays the game, the only rational play is Red-True.
3. If Anisa knows that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415 while she is playing the game, then Blue-True is a rational play.

There are three assumptions, so there are three ways we could resist the conclusion that Anisa's knowledge is sensitive to her practical situation.

First, we could reject the anti-sceptical assumption 1. But as we saw, this will lead to a sweeping scepticism. This is intuitively implausible, and as we'll see below, doesn't on its own solve the problem.

Second, we could reject the intuition that rationality requires playing Red-True. It is good to be careful about intuitions in tricky cases, and as I'll discuss in section \@ref(principles), I don't want to rely at all on intuitions about what Anisa knows. But this one feels pretty secure; don't bet on history when you could bet on simple arithmetic.

So that just leaves the last step. When setting up the argument, we reasoned to 3 from K-Suff, so you might try to resist the argument by arguing against K-Suff. I think K-Suff is true, and I'll argue for this at greater length in section \@ref(agency). But I want to start by noting how the argument doesn't rely on K-Suff in full generality. Rather, it just relies on the idea that we need to explain why Red-True is a rational play and Blue-True is not, and the best explanation is that Anisa knows that two plus two is four, but does not know when the Battle of Agincourt took place.

Once we frame the argument that way, there is a natural kind of reply to make. Perhaps Anisa knows both what two plus two is, and when the Battle of Agincourt took place. But she *super-knows* the first of these, and merely knows the second. And that explains why she can only rationally play Red-True.

What do we mean here by *super knowledge*? Think of this as a placeholder for certainty, or knowledge that one knows, or epistemic probability one, or anything other epistemic state that you think might be relevant to her practical decision making. Perhaps the fact that she super-knows (in one of these senses) what two plus two is, but doesn't super-know when the epistemology books were published, could be the explanation for why Red-True is the unique rational play. That we need some kind of super-knowledge for action, and not mere knowledge, is a popular, and natural, explanation of the case. For versions of this explanation, obviously with more details than I've given here, see for example arguments by Jessica @Brown2008 and by Jennifer @Lackey2010. Since the neologism 'super-knowledge' is a placeholder, there are different ways such an alternative explanation might be developed. 

But no such explanation can work, because Anisa doesn't super-know that playing Red-True will win \$50. She super-knows that two plus two is four. But we have not assumed that she super-knows the rules of the game. And any super-knowledge based explanation of why she should play Red-True requires her to super-know the rules of the game. I'm going to run through two ways of spelling out this objection to the super-knowledge reply, but I want to stress at the start that they are versions of the same point.

Let's start with the distinction that gets the super-knowledge idea going.

* Anisa knows and super-knows that two plus two is four.
* Anisa knows but does not super-know that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415.

On its own, it isn't clear why this would be sigificant. What would be significant is if we had the following distinction.

* Anisa knows and super-knows that playing Red-True will win \$50.
* Anisa knows but does not super-know that playing Blue-True will win \$50.

But how could we motivate the first bullet point? I think the most promising way is to reason as follows.

1. Anisa super-knows that two plus two is four.
2. Anisa super-knows that the red sentence is "Two plus two equals four", and that this means that two plus two equals four.
3. Anisa super-knows the rules of the game.
4. So, Anisa super-knows that if she plays Red-True, she will win \$50 iff two plus two equals four. (From 2, 3)
5. So, Anisa super-knows that if she plays Red-True, she will win \$50.

And the problem is that step 3 is just false. She was told what the rules are, but she was also told that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415. We should think that she super-knows the rules iff she super-knows when the Battle was. And once we do that, the super-knowledge explanation of the asymmetry fails.

Put another way, if Anisa knows that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415, then she knows that she is playing the following game. 

1.  Two sentences will be written on the board, one in red, one in blue.
2.  The player chooses to play either Blue-True, Blue-False, Red-True,
    or Red-False.
3.  If they play Blue-True, they win \$50.
4.  If they play Blue-False, they win nothing.
5.  If they play Red-True, they win \$50 if the red sentence is true,
    and nothing otherwise.
6.  If they play Red-False, they win \$50 if the red sentence is false,
    and nothing otherwise.

And is is rational to play Blue-True in that game. (It might also be rational to pay Red-True depending on what the red sentence is, but it is always rational to play Blue-True.) Yet it is not rational to play Blue-True in the original game. So Anisa does not know, when she plays the original game, that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415.

If we say that super knowledge is required for action, then we have to say that as specified, it is unclear what Anisa should do in this revised game. She knows all these things, but until we know what she super knows, we can't say what she should do. (Or perhaps until we super know what she super knows we can't say what she should do.) This is implausible; it is clear from the description of the revised game that Blue-True is a rational move.

Returning to the original game, there is one last way to explain the asymmetry (i.e., why Red-True is permissible but Blue-True is not) without saying that Anisa loses her historical knowledge. Perhaps we could try to restore the asymmetry by saying that while Anisa knows that playing Red-True will win \$50, she does not really know that playing Blue-True will win \$50. After all, so far we have only specified that she knows the rules of the game, what the blue sentence is, what that sentence means, and that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415. Those four claims logically entail that playing Blue-True will win \$50, and Anisa presumably can know that they entail that playing Blue-True will win \$50, but perhaps, as Fred @Dretske2005 has argued, that isn't enough to imply that Anisa knows that entail that playing Blue-True will win \$50. Perhaps this is a case where someone does not know, and cannot know, the known consequences of things they know.

But this is a desperate move, and it fails for several reasons. For one thing, this case is nothing like the cases that motivate Dretske and others to say that one does not always know the known implications of what one knows. Those cases are cases where, to use Crispin Wright's terminology, warrant to believe the premises of an argument does not provide warrant to believe the conclusion [@Wright2000-WRICAQ]. Here the reasons Anisa has to believe each premise are excellent reasons to believe the conclusion. Put more bluntly, it is completely implausible that knowledge should fail at precisely this point in this case. And note that if we say Anisa doesn't know this as a way to block an argument for IRT, then we have to say that she doesn't know it no matter what the red sentence is. This is even more unintuitive. Had the red sentence been something Anisa was ignorant about, she should intuitively play Blue-True because that would be something she knows would win.

There is, I think, one big asymmetry between Red-True and Blue-True. Given Anisa's evidence, it is more probable that two plus two is four than that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415. And Anisa should maximise expected utility. That's why she should play Red-True. I will go into this point in much more detail in chapter \@ref(knowledge), but the big thing to note at this stage is that this explanation of the asymmetry is not an alternative to IRT. Rather, IRT is the best form of such an explanation.

When I introduced the argument, I said that it was an argument for a disjunctive conclusion: either IRT is true, or scepticism is true. After all, the conclusion was that Anisa didn't know when the Battle of Agincourt was while playing the game. So either she did know that before the game started, and IRT is true, or she did not, and then similar reasoning will get us to scepticism. But note that if we're trying to explain the intuitive asymmetry - Red-True is rational but Blue-True is not - scepticism will be of no help. Anisa needs to take the structure of the game for granted in order for that asymmetry to exist. If scepticism is true it isn't clear why she must take it for granted, or even that she can take it for granted. The sceptic who wants to explain intuitions about rational action needs some notion like 'rationally taking for granted', and the Red-Blue game suggests this notion will be interest-relative. Anisa should not take the date of the Battle of Agincourt for granted in this game, but she should take it for granted in other situations. In other words, the sceptic needs a concept that plays a similar functional role to the role that the non-sceptic thinks knowledge plays, and they need that concept to be interest-relative. This point has some relevance to the historical precursors to IRT that I will discuss in section @\ref(history).
