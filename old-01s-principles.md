## Arguments from Principles and Arguments from Cases {#principles}

In the literature to date, there are two primary motivations for IRT. One comes from intuitions about cases, the other from a pair of principles. I'm going to set them both out here in order to stress how much more the argument here resembles the argument from principles than it resembles the argument from cases.

In his book on IRT, Jason @Stanley2005 starts with some versions of the 'bank cases' due originally to Keith @DeRose1992. These turn on idiosyncratic, archaic details of the US payments system, and I find it hard to have clear intuitions about them. A cleaner pair of examples is provided by Angel @Pinillos2012; here are slightly modified versions of his examples.

> Cerise and Dewi each have an essay due. They have, surprisingly, written word for word identical papers, and are now checking the paper for typos. The papers have no typos, and each student has checked their paper twice, with the same dictionary, and not found any typos. They are, in general, equally good at finding typos, and have true beliefs about their proficiency at typo-spotting.
>
> The only difference between them concerns the consequence of a typo remaining. If the paper is a borderline A/A- paper, a typo might mean Cerise gets an A- rather than an A. But the grade doesn't matter to her; she's already been accepted into a good graduate program next year so long as she gets above a C. But Dewi's instructor is a stickler for spelling. Any typo and he gets a C on the paper. And he has a very lucrative scholarship that he loses if he doesn't get at least a B on this paper. (Compare the Typo-Low and Typo-High examples in @Pinillos2012 [199].)

The intuition that helps IRT is that Cerise knows she has no typos in her paper, and should turn it in, while Dewi does not know this, and should do a third (and perhaps fourth or fifth) check. Since Cerise and Dewi only differ in their interests, that implies that knowledge is interest-relative. That's a version of the argument from cases.

The argument from principles takes off from the idea that knowledge plays an important role in good deliberation, and that knowledge does not require maximal confidence. I've basically already set that argument out when discussing Anisa. Normally, she knows that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415. But she can't act on that in the context of the Red-Blue game. So when she takes an interest in that game, she doesn't know that the Battle of Agincourt was in 1415.

The point I want to stress here about this argument is that it does not take as a premise that Anisa loses knowledge. So it isn't in any way relying on intuitions about what Anisa knows (whatever intuitions turn out to be). The argument instead relies on two other things. One is a premise about what is rational to do in Anisa's situation. If I'm relying on intuitions anywhere in the argument, it is here. There is a good sense in which I'm relying on an intuition that rationality requires playing Red-True rather than Blue-True. But it's the second premise of the argument that is, in practice, more controversial. That premise is that K-Suff, or something very much like it, is true. And that's something I'm going to spend more time arguing for as the book goes along.

The discussion of IRT in @HawthorneStanley2008 uses the converse of K-Suff. Again following the naming convention suggested by Jessica @Brown2013, I'll call this K-Nec.

K-Nec

:   An agent can properly use *p* as a reason for action only if she
    knows that *p*.

I'll mostly set the discussion of K-Nec aside here, since my preferred argument for IRI, the argument from Anisa's case, merely relies on K-Suff. But it is interesting to work through how K-Nec helps plug a gap in the argument by cases for IRT.

@BuckwalterSchaffer2015 argue that the intuitions behind Pinillos's examples are not as solid as we might like. It's true that experimental subjects do say that Dewi has to check the paper more times than Cerise does before he knows that the paper contains no typos. But those subjects also say he has to check more times before he believes that the paper has no typos. And, surprisingly, they say that he has to check more time before he guesses the paper has no typos. They suggest that there might be interest-relativity in the modal 'has' as much as in the verb 'knows'. To say someone 'has' to X before they Y, typically means that it is improper, in some way, to Y without doing X first. That won't be a problem for the proponent of IRT as long as at least in some of the cases Pinillos studies, the relevant senses of propriety are connected to knowledge. And that's plausible for belief; Dewi has to know the paper is typo free before he (properly) believes it. At least, that's a plausible move given K-Nec. (I'm suggesting here that in some sense, knowledge is a norm of belief. This will become an important theme in what follows.)

Think back to the discussion of stakes and odds in section \@ref(oddsandstakes). If our motivation for IRT came from cases, then it is natural to believe **Stakes**. Both Dewi and Anisa face bets on *p* at long odds, but intuition is more worried about whether Dewi knows that *p* than
whether Anisa does. (At least my intuition is worried about whether Dewi knows, and I've seen little evidence that Anisa's case is intuitively a case of non-knowledge.)

But if our motivation for IRT came from principles, then it is natural to believe **Odds**. As I noted back in section \@ref(oddsandstakes), an argument for IRT is that it lets us endorse four principles that are individually plausible, but collectively in some tension. In that sense, it is a more conservative theory than interest-invariant theories; it doesn't require wholescale revision of our theory of action. Now most epistemologists don't think IRT is conservative; they think it is absurdly radical. So I want to spend a bit of time noting how deeply embedded these principles are in our ordinary theorising.
