### Practically Irrelevant Propositions {#irrelevant}

The next three subsections concern ways in which the hybrid pragmatist theory is able to solve puzzles that, in retrospect, seem fatal to the theory of belief I endorsed back in "Can We Do Without Pragmatic Encroachment?". That theory also had two parts, like the hybrid pragmatist theory, but the parts were somewhat different. Simplifying just a little, the theory of that paper was that _S_ believes that $p$ only if these two conditions were met.

1. _S_'s credence in $p$ is above 0.5.
2. For all _A, B_ that _S_ is interested in, _S_ prefers _A_ to _B_ iff she prefers _A_ to _B_ given $p$.

I had hoped to get by with just clause 2, but I realised that wouldn't work because of practically irrelevant propositions. These are propositions that don't make a difference to any choice that one is presently interested in. If one is rushing to get through the daily errands, one's actual preferences over the live options will be the same as one's preferences over those options conditional on each of the following claims.

* The Battle of Avignon was in 1415.
* The Battle of Avignon was in 1416.
* The Battle of Avignon was in 1417.

And so on, at least for a while. Conditional on the Battle of Avignon having been in 2037, one might prefer to drop one's focus on the errands and question one's large-scale world view. But it's a while until the conditions get that intellectually destructive. And this clearly doesn't imply that one believes every one of those claims about when the battle was.

So I added clause 1, requiring credence above 0.5 to get out of this problem. But Jacob Ross and Mark Schroeder [-@RossSchroeder2014] pointed out that this only delayed the problem, not avoided it. What follows is a version of their example about Dal√≠'s moustache, purged of any worries about vagueness. I'm also going to offer a slight different argument for why my old theory is wrong. But still, the underlying point is one they make.

Let *d* be the number of games that the Detroit Tigers won in 1976 (in the MLB regular season). And consider these three propositions.

D0.  $d$ is not a multiple of 3.
D1.  $d$ is not 1 more than a multiple of 3.
D2.  $d$ is not 2 more than a multiple of 3.

On purely mathematical grounds, I am sure that precisely two of these three are true. But they are roughly equally probable, so my credence in each is above 0.5. And they are (most of the time) all practically irrelevant. So by the theory of belief I'd defended earlier, they are all things I believe.

Ross and Schroeder worry that this means that according to that theory, I'm inconsistent, since I believe each of those things and the negation of their conjunction. I don't think that's a real problem; surely I am inconsistent somewhere. The simpler point is that it's just obvious that I don't believe any of these on purely probabilistic grounds.

And the hybrid pragmatic theory gets this case right. According to it, I would believe D0 only if there were a pair of choices _A, B_ with the following two characteristics.

* I regard _B_ as weakly dominating _A_.
* Conditional on $d$ being a multiple of 3, I do not regard _B_ as weakly dominating _A_, since _A_ might be better than _B_.

And I very much doubt that such a pair exists. If _A_ might do better than _B_ conditional on $\neg D0$, I'm not going to think _B_ dominates _A_. For all I know, $d$ is a multiple of 3.

It's a little interesting to think about variants on this case, where there is some large number and we think about what the remainder might be when it is divided by 1000, or by 10000. Could we get to a point where a choice that is better than some alternative unless that remainder is, say 537, feel like a dominating choice? I'm not sure whether that would ever happen. But it does seem plausible to say that whether such a choice ever feels like a dominating choice correlates with whether we could ever straight up believe that the remainder is not precisely 537 on purely probabilistic grounds.
