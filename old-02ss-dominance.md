### Using Propositions in Dominance Reasoning {#dominance}

To understand the first clause in my hybrid pragmatist theory, it helps to think about the story of Sully. Sully is a fan of the Boston Red Sox, and one of the happiest days of his life was when the Red Sox broke their 86 year long curse, and won baseball's World Series in 2004. He knows, and hence believes, that the Red Sox won the World Series in 2004. He likes their chances to win again this year, because in Sully's heart, hope always springs eternal. 

It's now the start of a new baseball season, and Sully is offered, for free, a choice between the following two bets.

* Bet A wins $50 if the Red Sox win the World Series this year, and nothing otherwise.
* Bet B wins $60 if the same team wins the World Series this year as won in 2004, and nothing otherwise.

For Sully, this choice is a no-brainer. If the Red Sox win this year, he wins more money taking B than A. If the Red Sox don't win this year, he gets nothing either way. So it's better to take B than A, and that's what he does.

What Sully has done here is use dominance reasoning, in particular weak dominance reasoning. One option weakly dominates another if it might have a better return, and can't have a worse return. Weak dominance is used as an analytical tool in game theory. But it is also a form of inference that non-theorists, like Sully can use. (Though unless they've taken a game theory course they might not use this phrase to describe it.) 

We can distinguish Sully's case from that of his more anxious friend Mack. Mack is also a big Red Sox fan, and also looks back on that curse-busting World Series win with fondness. But if you offer Mack the choice between these two bets, he'll hesitate a bit. He'll wonder if he's really sure it was 2004 that the Red Sox won. Maybe it was 2005 he thinks. He'll eventually think that even if he's not completely sure that it was 2004, it was very likely 2004, and so it is very likely that bet B will do better, and that's what he will take.^[The example here, and the conclusion I'm drawing from it, is modelled on the 'Renzo' example in @SchroederRoss2012.]

Even if Sully and Mack end up at the same point, they have used very different forms of reasoning. Sully uses weak dominance reasoning, while Mack uses probabilistic reasoning. Sully takes the fact that the Red Sox won in 2004 as given, while Mack just takes it to be very likely. The big thing I want to rely on here is that these are very different psychological processes. Neither of these guys is doing something that approximates, or simplifies, the other; they are using completely different styles of reasoning.

There is a theoretical analog to this psychological point. Most game theorists think that weak dominance reasoning can be iterated more or less indefinitely. (Though there are some notable exceptions.) But few think that likelihood reasoning can be iterated indefinitely. This reflects the fact that they are very different kinds of reasoning. Dominance reasoning is pre-probabilistic.

Sully's reasoning isn't just dominance reasoning. It's dominance reasoning that relies on some very specific assumptions. When Sully reasons that A can't do better than B, he's not drawing any kind of logical or metaphysical point. It's logically and metaphysically possible that the Red Sox lost in 2004. For that matter, and this is a point @Ganson2019 stresses, it's logically and metaphysically possible that the payouts for A and B are other than what Sully thinks they are.

And thought he might not make it explicit, at some level Sully surely knows this. If pushed, he'd endorse the conditional "If I've misremembered when the curse-busting World Series win was, and the Red Sox didn't win in 2004, then bet A might do better than bet B". So while he is disposed to use dominance reasoning in deciding whether to take A or B, this disposition rests on taking some facts about the world for granted.

That's what I mean by using a proposition in dominance reasoning. _S_ is disposed to use $p$ in dominance reasoning in the choice of _B_ over _A_ just in case these two conditions are met.

1. They are disposed to regard _B_ as being better than _A_ because it could result in a better outcome, and couldn't result in a worse outcome.
2. They are disposed to accept that if $p$ is not the case, then _A_ might result in a better outcome than _B_.

And that's the first clause of the hybrid pragmatic theory of belief spelled out. I'll make two small observations about it before moving on.

First, I mean the cognitive verbs here, 'regard' and 'accept', to be read in a very lightweight way. I don't mean that _S_ could express any of these sentences to themselves, either in English or any other language. One might regard _B_ as clearly better than _A_, and this regard be manifest by an unhesitating choice of _B_, not by any spoken or silent utterance of clause 1. If there is a creature that is so basic that we can't make sense of the difference between it using dominance reasoning and it using probabilistic reasoning, then I think we can't sensibly talk about it having beliefs. 

Second, my version of the hybrid pragmatic theory only requires that _S_ be willing to do use $p$ in one possible choice. It doesn't have to be anything like actual. (Indeed, Sully is unlikely to have strangers offer him these free money bets.) But nor do I say this disposition has to be stable across all choices, or even across choices generically. I don't say the first because that would get the wrong results in the Red-Green game. And I don't say the second because I want to allow for inconsistent beliefs. We can imagine someone who is prepared to use $p$ in dominance reasoning in one pair of puzzles, to use $q$ in dominance reasoning in another pair, and $p \leftrightarrow \neg q$ in a third pair. I want to say that person has inconsistent beliefs (unless they are bailed out by the second clause in the hybrid pragmatic theory). Indeed, it is the fact that they have inconsistent beleifs that will explain why these three pieces of reasoning will probably end badly. But if we say _S_ must be generally disposed to use a proposition in dominance reasoning in order to believe it, it seems likely that we'll say they believe none of these things. In the ordinary case, a rational person who will use $p$ for one decision will use it in most places it is relevant. But we need to allow for the extra-ordinary cases too, and weakening the quantifier here does so. I'll return to this point in subsection \@ref(usc).
