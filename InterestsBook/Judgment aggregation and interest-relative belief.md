Judgment aggregation and interest-relative belief

Here's a picture:

* Say that the credences of the group are constituted by the credences of the whole via some good credence-aggregation method. Preferably something Levinstein-style rather than something like arithmetic like. This should be summative in some sense, but again, not by adding numbers.
* Use the more-or-less same method for getting from credences to beliefs that I use in the individual case.
* But some propositions might be salient to the group that are not salient to any individual. For instance, if _p_ is salient to some, and _q_ to others, then _p & q_ might be salient to group although not salient to any individual.
