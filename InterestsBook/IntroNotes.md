The first part of this book defends a number of theses about *belief*. I'll start by clarifying a little what I take the topic here to be. I don't think this should be too surprising to philosophers. What I'm going to say is that the topic is the philosophers' conception of belief. But it is worth noting how distinctive a conception that is.

The verb 'believe' is frequently used in ordinary English. But many of its usages do not match up with the philosophical conception I'm interested in. For instance, neither B's usage of the term in (1), nor D's usage in (2), match that conception.

(1)	A: Are the Red Sox playing today?
	B: I believe so, but I better check, because they sometimes have off days this early in the season.
(2)	C: How is your daughter doing at school?
	D: Oh, she's doing great, but she has trouble relating to some of the children because she doesn't believe in Santa Claus.

In (1), it looks like B self-attributes a state of belief, in particular, a belief that the Red Sox are playing. But unless B is particularly irrational, she can't be completely confident that the Red Sox are playing. One doesn't need to check that the Red Sox are playing if one is sure they are. In practice, statements like "I believe so" communicate that the speaker is confident that the question asked is true, but not completely sure. 

Note how odd it would have been for B to answer with "Yes, but I better check, because they sometimes have off days this early in the season." In the sense of belief I'm interested in, her initial "Yes" expresses a belief that the Red Sox are playing. And that belief is incompatible with feeling a need to check that they are(at least in standard cases).

The divergence between the usage I'm interested in is more pronounced in (2) The notion of belief that I'm interested in is, exclusively, a relation that holds between believers and a content. I'll usually assume that content is a proposition. (Indeed, I'll take this as somewhat stimulative for these purposes; propositions just are the things we believe.) Whatever it is to believe in God, it doesn't seem to be believing a proposition.

You might think that when someone says that S believes in God, what they are really saying is that S believes that God exists. And believing that God exists clearly is a relation to a proposition. But there's reason to doubt that's how we should interpret sentences like (2). After all, "I believe in the University of Michigan" typically doesn't mean that I believe that the University of Michigan exists.

Alternatively, you might think that there's one core notion of belief, that can relate a person with either a proposition or an object. The model would be views of desire [citation needed] on which someone can desire that _p_, e.g., that the war end, or desire _X_, e.g., desire an apple, and this is the very same type of mental state, just with different kinds of objects. It would take us too far afield to get into either this debate about desire, or the question of whether we should treat desire and belief the same way in this respect. So I'll just note that I'm assuming that belief is a relation to a content, and that any relation one bears to a thing, e.g., God or the University of Michigan, is a different relation.

There is a substantial distance between the philosophers' conception of belief, and the usage of the English verb 'believe' in (1) and (2). This is borne out by the relationship between belief and knowledge in standard philosophical theories.

Nowadays, virtually no one believes that knowledge is justified true belief. The arguments of [#Gettier1963] showed that is so. But no one thinks that the following is a good argument against the identification of knowledge with justified true belief. In (1), B has a belief that the Red Sox are playing. And we can easily imagine that the Red Sox are playing, and that B is justified in having exactly the attitude towards the proposition that she actually has; i.e., being somewhat confident it is true, but thinking that inquiry into whether the proposition is true is not complete. Yet she clearly doesn't know that the Red Sox are playing; knowledge puts an end to inquiry. So here's a case of justified true belief without knowledge.

Now that's no good as an example, because in the envisaged scenario, B simply doesn't believe, in the sense we're interested in, that the Red Sox are playing. And we can see that this is how philosophers have understood the case by noting that not a single one of the many, many, many attempts to 'solve the Gettier problem' since 1963 have included clauses that would deal with cases like this one. That is, none of these analyses have held that a belief can fall short of knowledge in virtue of being held with insufficient confidence. Some philosophers have held that we can have knowledge without belief; this is argued for in [#Radford19xx], and subsequently endorsed in [#Lewis1996a]. But no one, to my knowledge, has held that cases like (1) shows that belief is not a confident enough mental state for knowledge.


Prominent anti-analyst Williamson thinks belief is "attempted knowledge" â€¦

Summary: Belief is taking as settled

Caveat: Not taking stand on whether the differences between folk and philosophical usages are semantic or pragmatic.

#### Three Puzzles ####

1. Belief and credence
2. Belief and conjunctions
3. Belief and action

#### Belief and Credence ####

What is the relation?
Seems must be constitutive; low credence is incompatible with belief. Not just rationally incompatible; really so.
Seems can't be belief = credence 1
So what is it.

#### Belief and Conjunctions ####

Settling each conjunction settles conjunct
But preface paradox!
If credence = prob 1, get conjunction, don't get preface, get absurdity
If credence = prob > t, 'solve' preface paradox, but lose closure too

#### Belief and Action ####

Do some kind of bank case (probably with peanuts)
Three options

1. Belief only when strong enough to take any action
2. Won't do the thing you believe will lead to better outcome than thing actually done.
3. Belief changes when situation changes

If belief = credence 1, then option 1
If belief = credence > t, then option 2
I'm defending option 3
Belief = sufficiently high credence
Not just for practical things - could think to self "What would I serve to X", where X is not around, and allergic to peanuts.
