Plan for Interest-Relativity Book

# Belief #

* Defining the Target
	* Not ordinary "I believe"
	* More like settled the question
* Problems about conjunction
* Problems about long-shot bets
Inputs: ss1,2 of CWD; intro of KBI, intro of GBC

# Belief and Interests #

* Setting out Interest-Relative Account
* Importance of theoretical as well as practical interests; responses to Brown and to Ross&Schroeder
* How to handle impractical propositions
* Caveats about modals - need to fuss about updating for epistemic modals, need to fuss about conditional values claims for 
Inputs: ss2,3 of CWD; s2 of KBI; part of s1 of GBC (updating), part of s3 of GBC (theoretical interests part)

# Conjunctions and Prefaces #

* Prove that we keep a form of conjunction closure
* Argue that's closure enough
* Reject Christensen's arguments that preface shows we should have less closure
Inputs: ss4,5,6 of CWD

# Beliefs and Action #

* Interest-relative explanation of the high-stakes/long-shot cases
* Note that it is odds, not stakes, that matter.
* Respond to Fantl&McGrath's objections to this way of doing things
* Respond to Ross&Schroeder's Stability objection
Input: s6,7 of CWD; intro of DIRI; part of s3 of GBC (stability)


# Games, Decisions and Knowledge #

* How Knowledge enters into decision theory (s1 of KBI)
* How Knowledge enters into game theory (s1 of GBC)
Inputs: s1 of KBI, s1 of GBC

# Knowledge and Justification #

* How games show knowledge has its own interest-relativity, not reducible to interest-relativity of belief (s3 of KBI)
* Williamson's argument that JTB without knowledge is everywhere (s1 of M&E)
* How this shows everything ever said about "Gettier cases" is wrong (s2, 3 of M&E)
Inputs: s3 of KBI, s1-3 of M&E

# Objections to Interest-Relativism #

* Whack-a-mole on objections
Input: DIRI

# Credences #

* Big project of chapter: defend use of credences in epistemology
* Show how to reduce credences to comparative confidence
* Perhaps, respond to Ben Levinstein's accuracy-based objections to doing this
* Show that the reduction supports probabilism
Inputs: s2 of GBC, chapter 3 of dissertation

# Contextualism #

* Some people try to explain some of the data I've used with contextualist tools
* Lots of reason to think that won't work
* Ordinary language data about questions doesn't support contextualism
* And contextualism doesn't help resolve good arguments for scepticism
Inputs: QC, some stuff from scepticism papers
