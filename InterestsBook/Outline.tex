\chapter{Plan for Interest-Relativity Book}

\section*{Introduction}
What the view is:
\begin{itemize*}
\item An interest-relative theory of belief
\item An interest-relative theory of knowledge
\item Used to hope that the second was solely derived from the first; now not so clear
\end{itemize*}
What's distinctive about the view:
\begin{itemize*}
\item Invariantist
\item Grounded in a theory of belief
\item Integrated with game theory and decision theory; supports, and supported by, an epistemic interpretation of some problematic parts of game theory and decision theory.
\end{itemize*}

\noindent 

\noindent 

\section{Belief}
\label{belief}

\begin{itemize*}
\item Defining the Target

\begin{itemize*}
\item Not ordinary ``I believe''

\item More like settled the question

\end{itemize*}

\item Problems about conjunction

\item Problems about long-shot bets

\end{itemize*}
Inputs: ss1,2 of CWD; intro of KBI, intro of GBC

\section{Belief and Interests}
\label{beliefandinterests}

\begin{itemize*}
\item Setting out Interest-Relative Account

\item Importance of theoretical as well as practical interests; responses to Brown and to Ross\&Schroeder

\item How to handle impractical propositions

\item Caveats about modals - need to fuss about updating for epistemic modals, need to fuss about conditional values claims for

\end{itemize*}
Inputs: ss2,3 of CWD; s2 of KBI; part of s1 of GBC (updating), part of s3 of GBC (theoretical interests part)

\section{Conjunctions and Prefaces}
\label{conjunctionsandprefaces}

\begin{itemize*}
\item Prove that we keep a form of conjunction closure

\item Argue that's closure enough

\item Reject Christensen's arguments that preface shows we should have less closure

\end{itemize*}
Inputs: ss4,5,6 of CWD

\section{Beliefs and Action}
\label{beliefsandaction}

\begin{itemize*}
\item Interest-relative explanation of the high-stakes\slash long-shot cases

\item Note that it is odds, not stakes, that matter.

\item Respond to Fantl\&McGrath's objections to this way of doing things

\item Respond to Ross\&Schroeder's Stability objection
\end{itemize*}
Input: s6,7 of CWD; intro of DIRI; part of s3 of GBC (stability)


\section{Games, Decisions and Knowledge}
\label{gamesdecisionsandknowledge}

\begin{itemize*}
\item How Knowledge enters into decision theory (s1 of KBI)

\item How Knowledge enters into game theory (s1 of GBC)

\end{itemize*}
Inputs: s1 of KBI, s1 of GBC

\section{Knowledge and Justification}
\label{knowledgeandjustification}

\begin{itemize*}
\item How games show knowledge has its own interest-relativity, not reducible to interest-relativity of belief (s3 of KBI)

\item Williamson's argument that JTB without knowledge is everywhere (s1 of M\&E)

\item How this shows everything ever said about ``Gettier cases'' is wrong (s2, 3 of M\&E)

\end{itemize*}
Inputs: s3 of KBI, s1--3 of M\&E

\section{Objections to Interest-Relativism}
\label{objectionstointerest-relativism}

\begin{itemize*}
\item Whack-a-mole on objections

\end{itemize*}
Input: DIRI

\section{Credences}
\label{credences}

\begin{itemize*}
\item Big project of chapter: defend use of credences in epistemology

\item Show how to reduce credences to comparative confidence

\item Perhaps, respond to Ben Levinstein's accuracy-based objections to doing this

\item Show that the reduction supports probabilism

\end{itemize*}
Inputs: s2 of GBC, chapter 3 of dissertation

\section{Contextualism}
\label{contextualism}

\begin{itemize*}
\item Some people try to explain some of the data I've used with contextualist tools

\item Lots of reason to think that won't work

\item Ordinary language data about questions doesn't support contextualism

\item And contextualism doesn't help resolve good arguments for scepticism

\end{itemize*}
Inputs: QC, some stuff from scepticism papers

\section*{Conclusion}
Wrap it all up!
