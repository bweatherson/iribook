There is a tension between the following three claims.

1. We know a lot.
2. If one knows that action $A$ will do better than action $B$, and all one cares about is getting the best outcome, then one should do $A$.
3. There are very few propositions that one should bet on no matter how long the odds are.

The tension between them is fairly straightforward to spell out, and looks like it reveals a contradiction between the three claims. 

Let $p$ be one of the many things one knows. Assume one is offered a bet that pays a trivial sum if $p$ is true, and loses a fortune if $p$ is false.  And assume that there is no cost or benefit to taking the bet, other than the amount the bet pays off. By principle 2, one should take the bet; one knows taking it will do better than not taking it (by the 'trivial sum' that one wins). But replicating this reasoning for each of the many things one knows contradicts the claim that there are few propositions one should bet on no matter how long the odds. After all, it looks like we just showed there are many propositions, all the ones one knows, that one should bet on no matter how long the odds.

There are several interesting ways to resolve the tension. We could join the sceptics in rejecting 1, and say that we don't know very much at all. We could join a recent tradition of radical anti-scepticism and reject 3, saying that in some good sense we should take these long odds bets. Perhaps there is some sense in which taking the bets is bad; perhaps they reveal bad character [#LasonenAarnio2014], or bad habits [#SrinivasanHawthorne2013]. But, says this view, the bets themselves are good to take.
