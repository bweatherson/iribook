With that in mind, consider the below game, which I'll call \textbackslash{}RG.\footnote{Note that I'm here disagreeing with my treatment of this game in ~\citep{Weatherson2012-WEAGAT}.} Informally, in this game $A$ and $B$ must each play either a green or red card. I will capitalise $A$'s moves, i.e., $A$ can play GREEN or RED, and italicise $B$'s moves, i.e., $B$ can play \emph{green} or \emph{red}. If two green cards, or one green card and one red card are played, each player gets \$1. If two red cards are played, each gets nothing. Each cares just about their own wealth, so getting \$1 is worth 1 util. All of this is common knowledge. More formally, here is the game table, with $A$ on the row and $B$ on the column.
