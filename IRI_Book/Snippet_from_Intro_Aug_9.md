And the main way that interests come in is that when something is not interesting, that lowers a requirement for knowledge that would otherwise be in place. More precisely, there are two ways in which interests matter in the theory I'm developing.

First, there are coherence constraints on knowledge, one of which is **Knowledge is Given**. Sometimes these constraints do not apply in virtue of the irrelevance of some choices. Yesterday, F01 knew when the Magna Carta was signed, in part because she was not thinking about the choice between AT and BT. We can put this point in terms of defeaters, if we're willing to accept that ideology. The irrationality of picking BT when AT is a rival choice defeats F01's claim to knowledge that the Magna Carta was signed in 1215. But the irrelevance of that choice, when it is actually irrelevant, defeats that defeater. I don't want to commit to the ideology of defeaters, but that is a helpful way to see the depth that interests come in at; whether something is a defeater to a defeater depends on what interests the agent has.

Second, there are reliability constraints on mechanisms that produce evidence. A mechanism that is not reliable does not produce evidence, even on the occasions that it works. But reliability is a gradable notion. A thermometer bought from the local pharmacy is reliable, but the thermometers they use in labs and hospitals are considerably more reliable. This suggests some problems. Evidence is an on-off notion, but one of the conditions for producing evidence is gradable. How much reliability is needed to produce evidence, and how could whatever boundary we set between the reliable and the unreliable be significant enough to ground the distinction between evidence and non-evidence? As I'll outline in chapter 4, I think the answer here is interest-relative. Whether a mechanism is reliable enough to produce evidence depends on the agent's interests.

There is a common thread between these two ways that interests affect knowledge. What an agent knows is counterfactually dependent on what their interests are. But changes in interests are rarely directly explanatory of a change in knowledge. The explanations are always much more indirect. Interests affect how much evidence an agent has, or whether that evidence is strong enough for knowledge. F01 doesn't know that the Magna Carta was signed in 1215 because her evidence for that proposition is not strong enough. In some cases we'll see in chapter 4, agents with odd interests end up not having knowledge because they don't have any relevant evidence at all, although some of their counterparts have very strong evidence.

This is going to matter a lot for some of the challenges to interest-relativity we'll see in chapter 5. Many people think that interests are the wrong kind of thing to explain changes in knowledge. And in a sense, I agree. But think about the things that do explain knowledge. A person knows something because they believe it on the basis of good enough evidence. They have that evidence because it was the output of reliable enough mechanisms. How do we figure out what 'enough' in the last two sentences means? I think we consider the interests of the agent, though that is controversial. What might be less controversial is that any answer to these questions will have odd consequences.
